Vital signs are fundamental indicators of a patient's physiological status. Modern EHRs must support efficient and accurate management of this critical data stream.
- Data Capture:
    - Manual Entry: A structured interface for manually entering temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate with automatic timestamping and validation.
    - Device Integration: Automated, real-time data capture from connected medical devices (e.g., bedside monitors, ventilators) to reduce errors and provide continuous data.
- Trend Analysis: The ability to view vital signs graphically over time is essential for identifying subtle changes in a patient's condition.
- Alerting Systems: Configurable alert systems are crucial for patient safety. These systems should notify providers when vital signs are outside of normal ranges and integrate with Early Warning Score (EWS) systems to predict patient deterioration.
